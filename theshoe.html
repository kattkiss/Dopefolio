                This game was quite a passion project that me and my significant other made, me being the 
                Game Designer/Artist/Programmer and them being the Writer/Narrative Designer. The initial idea was that the 
                story would be something silly and the game be something simple and fun. While the idea remained in our 
                heads for a while, we didn't find the time to actually begin working on it until the summer of 2025. We 
                did take a break in September of that year but resumed development by January 2026.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Design Goal</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                While I can appreciate visual novels to a certain point, I feel that they often turn into just that, a
                visual novel...not a <strong>GAME</strong>. My design thinking ended up being boiled down to this:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Problem</strong>
                <br>
                - Visual novels often become <strong>passive</strong> reading experiences (IMO).
                <br>
                - Traditional visual novels allow players to skim text and skip interaction with little consequence.
                <br>
                - Meaningful choices are uncommon, reducing attention investment.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Objective</strong>
                <br>
                - Create a visual novel that feels like a <strong>game</strong>.
                <br>
                - Make reading <strong>active</strong> and <strong>engaging</strong>.
                <br>
                - Introduce mechanics that <strong>reinforce attention and consequence</strong>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Approach</strong>
                <br>
                - Mechanics should <strong>support narrative engagement</strong>, not distract from it. 
                <br>
                - Players should not be feel like they are being punished arbitrarily.  
                <br>
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">System: Time-Sensitive Choices</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Why this mechanic exists</strong>
                <br>
                - Discourages dialogue skimming and encourages engagement.
                <br>
                - Makes choices <strong>matter</strong> by putting them on a timer.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Tradeoffs</strong>
                <br>
                - No timer → Possibility of low engagement.
                <br>
                - Overly long timer → Risk of player skimming.
                <br>
                - Too short timer → Player frustration.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Final decision</strong>
                <br>
                - Timers appear when dialogue choices matter the most.
                <br>
                - If the player doesn't respond in time, the game makes the choice for them, 
                <strong>reducing agency</strong>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Expected outcome</strong>
                <br>
                - Encouraged attentive reading.
                <br>
                - Added tension and consequence to dialogue.

                <strong>Why this mechanic exists</strong>
                <br>
                - Breaks up narrative flow with a <strong>different interactive challenge</strong>.
                <br>
                - Encourages attention to motor skills as well as reading.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How it works</strong>
                <br>
                - A cursor moves back and forth.
                <br>
                - The player must press a button when the cursor is within a target "sweet spot". 
                <br>
                - Successful presses get harder over time (speed increases, window shrinks).
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Expected outcome</strong>
                <br>
                - Adds variation in challenge.
                <br>
                - Reinforces <strong>embodied attention</strong> during important moments.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Why this mechanic exists</strong>
                <br>
                - Narrative support! The player is drunk and their preception should reflect that.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How it works</strong>
                <br>
                - Uses a shader to distort visuals progressively.
                <br>
                - Intoxication changes with drinking or sobering up.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Expected outcome</strong>
                <br>
                - Visually communicates the state of the player without numbers.
                <br>
                - Altered perception links directly to the emotional and gameplay experience.

                - Early playtest showed intoxication effects were <strong>not obvious enough</strong>.
                <br>
                - Final playtest highlighted bugs in:

                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Changes made</strong>
