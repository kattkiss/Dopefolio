                <i><strong>The Shoe</strong> is about you, the player, waking up in the middle of the night at a home 
                party. When you decide to put on your shoes and go home, something isn't right. You can only find 
                <strong>one</strong> of your <strong>limited edition Matsune Hiku</strong> shoes. Where did the other
                one go? You obviously can't walk in the cold winter snow with a bare foot, can you?</i>

                This game was quite a passion project that me and my significant other made, me being the 
                Game Designer/Artist/Programmer and them being the Writer/Narrative Designer. The initial idea was that the 
                story would be something silly and the game be something simple and fun. While the idea remained in our 
                heads for a while, we didn't find the time to actually begin working on it until the summer of 2025. We 
                did take a break in September of that year but resumed development by January 2026.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Game Design</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                While I can appreciate visual novels to a certain point, I feel that they often turn into just that, a
                visual novel...not a <strong>GAME</strong>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                From my own experience, I usually end up just reading text on the screen, accompanied by some artwork 
                in the background. After a while, I will end up skimming through the text until something interesting 
                happens, as they are often linear, not leaving many meaningful choices or a sense of agency to the 
                player.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>THIS</strong> is what I wanted to change with this game. It was still going to contain what you
                would expect from a visual novel, but also contain choices that affect the player's experience and
                require them to act quickly during important moments of the story, making even the "skimmers" pay 
                attention.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Time-Sensitive Choices</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The first mechanic I added to the formula was <strong>Time-Sensitive Choices</strong>. The player would have a pop-up of 
                dialogue choices they can make, and they would be on a timer while making their choice. Not making a
                choice in time would have the game make it for them, taking away their agency.
                <br>
                <br>
                The idea behind this is that I am taking away the player's ability to tackle the game at their own pace,
                essentially challenging them. Without a mechanic like this, one might be like me and get tired of 
                reading after a while. Having this mechanic in the game, I believe that it adds some tension/friction 
                which could help with keeping players engaged for longer than they otherwise would.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another good thing about adding a mechanic like this to the game is that if the player wants to have a
                desirable result from the interaction, they would need to have understood what they had read before to
                make an educated decision. This does also, in turn, put the player's focus on the story which is the 
                main selling point of a game in this genre. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This mechanic was implemented in times it felt the most natural, such as in conversations (Don't let
                there be too much dead silence!) and when the player had to react quickly (someone is about to vomit on
                you).
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Quick Time Events</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                By incorporating <strong>Time-Sensitive Choices</strong>, I'm challenging the player's 
                <strong>attention to detail</strong>. With <strong>Quick Time</strong> Events I'm challenging their 
                <strong>motor skills</strong>.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                To essentially break up the flow of the game and make it less repetitive, not just being a few
                <strong>Time-Sensitive Choices</strong>, I needed to add something else. It needed to be something that
                challenged a different skill from the player so that it wouldn't feel too same-y. I thought a kind of 
                <strong>Quick Time Event</strong> would do nicely. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept is simple, the player has a cursor that is moving from side to side, and they need to time
                their button presses to when the cursor is within the "sweet spot". The speed of the cursor increases
                and the width of the "sweet spot" decreases with each successful buttonpress. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I decided to use this mechanic specifically for when the player in the game is performing something
                that requires proper motor skills, such as ascending a set of stairs while intoxicated. This way it
                feels natural for the player to be performing the task when put into the context of the scenario in 
                the game.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Levels Of Intoxication</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                As <strong>The Shoe</strong> is a game about experiences when under the influence, I thought that the 
                player should also <strong>feel</strong> like they are. Therefore, I added a shader that made the 
                background move and would intensify/detensify depending on whether the player decided to sober up or 
                continue drinking.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Art</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                All the artwork used in the game are stock photos that I heavily edited in 
                <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> to give them distorted faces (caused by the player being intoxicated
                or face-blind) and a cartoon-like appearance.
