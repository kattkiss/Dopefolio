                You are a <strong>rat</strong>. A <strong>rat</strong> with a <strong>food truck</strong> 
                (that you inherited when your uncle went to prison) and a love for food, but the world is ruled by cats 
                who look down on rats. Can you keep your secrecy and serve amazing food according to the customers 
                wishes and prove that rats can indeed be cooks? Or will you serve shit food and get caught by the 
                kitty cops as well?

                This game was made by me and some friends as part of our last "big" game project of our bachelor 
                degrees. I was one of two (2) designers in this project, thus we ended up splitting the design work. I was going
                to focus on <strong>designing the games systems</strong>, with 
                <strong>close communication with our programmer</strong>, while the other designer took care of level 
                design.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Design Goal</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                When the idea of a cooking game got pitched to me, I was analyzing some existing cooking games and saw
                that they had a trend in almost always being about <strong>using time</strong> to 
                <strong>pressure the player</strong>. <strong>What if a cooking game didn't do this?</strong> Here is my
                design thinking:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Problem</strong>
                <br>
                Cooking games too often use <strong>time</strong> to <strong>challenge</strong> the player.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Objective</strong>
                <br>
                Create a cooking game that uses other elements than time to create a sense of challenge.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Approach</strong>
                <br>
                - Through system design, challenge the player in ways that are not primarily time-limited.
                <br>
                - The player should feel pressured to make a <strong>perfect dish</strong> rather than 
                <strong>a quick one</strong>.
                <br>
              </p>

                <strong>Why this mechanic exists</strong>
                <br>
                - To <strong>simulate</strong> the experience of working in a restaurant (Food truck).
                <br>
                - To make the player <strong>navigate</strong> the <strong>environment</strong>.
                <br>
                - To make the player <strong>critically think</strong> about what dish they <strong>should</strong> be
                cooking. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How it works</strong>
                <br>
                1. The player picks up the chefs hat and walks up to the order window.
                <br>
                2. The player presses a button to take the order.
                <br>
                3. The customer will vaguely tell the player what they want to eat. For example: "I want something with
                tomatoes". 
                <br>
                4. An order has now been taken.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Expected outcome</strong>
                <br>
                - Encourage the player to be attentive to what the customer is saying.
                <br>
                - The player makes educated decisions based on what dish they think would fit each customer best.

                - To give the player a <strong>reason</strong> to <strong>navigate</strong> the environment.
                <br>
                - The main way for the player to <strong>progress</strong>.

                <strong>How it works</strong>
                <br>
                - Split into <strong>three (3) stations:</strong> Boiling, Cutting & Frying. 
                <br>
                - Boiling: Player throws an ingredient into the station and presses a button to begin boiling.
                <br>
                - Cutting: Player throws an ingredient into the station and <strong>repeatedly</strong> presses a 
                button to cut it up.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (Design-phase only) Minigame: The player needs to time their button presses 
                to when the indicator hits the sweet spot. See an example of this below.

                <strong>sides</strong> & <strong>Seasoning</strong>.
                <br>
                - <strong>No grade leads to a Game Over.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Expected outcome</strong>
                <br>
                - To not discourage the player from making mistakes as a result of experimentation but...
                <br>
                - ...Reward the player for performing well and in turn...
                <br>

                <br>
                <strong>Previous iterations</strong>
                <br>
                This system was before about each category of a dish increasing/reducing a final score based 
                on the player's performance. On reflection, this was interpreted to be <strong>overengineered</strong> 
                and thus <strong>thrown away</strong> and replace by the system above. Example of the old system can be 
                found below.

              <strong>How it works</strong>
              <br>
              - <strong>Boiling</strong> and <strong>Frying</strong> heats up ingredients.
              <br>
              - If the ingredient isn't being cooked, the heat level will decrease over time. 
              <br>
              - The heat level is used in grading of dishes. For example: The recipe requires the food to be warm. It 
              needs to have a specific heat level when turned in to be graded as <strong>Perfect</strong>. 
              <br>

              <strong>Expected outcome</strong>

              <br>
              - Each dish has 3 categories of taste: Sweetness, Heat, Saltiness.
              <br>
              - Each taste category is on a <strong>scale of 1 - 5</strong>. 
              <br>
              - Individual <strong>ingredients</strong> and the <strong>final dish</strong> can be seasoned.
              <br>
              - The player can taste the food to see what value the taste categories are on.
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Can be done up to two (2) times without ruining the dish.
              <br>
              - What each category should sit on is determined by the <strong>customer</strong> and the 
              <strong>recipe</strong>. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Expected outcome</strong>
              <br>
              - Player needs to be precise in their seasoning.
              <br>
              - Player learns how to get to the seasoning "sweet-spot" from experience, like a true chef!

              <strong>Why this exists</strong>
              <br>
              - To onboard players to the game's cooking mechanics because...
              <br>
              - ...Playtesters felt lost, unsure of what they were supposed to do.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>The Approach</strong>
              <br>
              - Player learns by doing, not by reading. 
              <br>
              - Used icons (such as big arrows) instead of words, when possible. 
              <br>
              - Game tells the player what to do, step-by-step.
              <br>
              - Big arrow above player points to where they need to go at all times.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Art & Presentation</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                - An "ugly", grimy and blocky artstyle was used to support the game's atmosphere and the skills of the 
                team. 
                <br>
                - Made and used <strong>smoke VFX</strong> to <strong>communicate vital information</strong> to the 
                player. For example: When something is cooking, when they are sprinting, etc. 
                <br>
                - Modeled most of the dishes and their ingredients.

                <br>
                - A dirty and raw art style fits a <strong>rat</strong> in a <strong>food truck</strong>.

                - Feedback about the tutorial:
                <br>

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Too much text?: In general, no. Good that essential words are

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Anything left unclear? No. 
                <br>
                - The gameplay-loop was generally <strong>appreciated</strong> but there could be...

                <br>

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- More <strong>variation</strong>.
                <br>
